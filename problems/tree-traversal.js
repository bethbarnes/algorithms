// Interviewer Prompt
// Today you will write a series of iterator functions for trees.

// breadthFirst
// depthFirstPreOrder
// (if time allows)

// depthFirstPostOrder
// Each of these function will take a node of the tree and a callback. The function will iterate through the child nodes, calling the callback function on each of them. The difference between them is the order in which they iterate.
